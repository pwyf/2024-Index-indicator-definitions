# 2024-Index-indicator-definitions
The consultation for the 2024 Aid Transparency Index rule-set test is now closed. 
We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the next Aid Transparency Index shortly after.

Please note that this consultation is only on data quality tests used for IATI XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. 
All indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.
